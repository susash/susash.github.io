<p>It took me twenty-one years to recognize that I am blessed with what is called Parents. Before that, I only knew that I had friends. Neither did they ever make an assertion nor did I care to revolt. Went on smooth, went on calm. It's still cool and calm; I don't know how.</p>

<p>Having dwelled for quarter of a century on this planet, I still find myself to be an orphan. Even though I realize, that they are my parents, we are friends. Tom made me see victory in defeat and Jerry taught me contentment. I always find them behind, wherever I am. They are there to support; they are there to listen and so they overhear.</p>

<p>There are moments when I have so much to say, and they can't help but listen but it gets tough when the equation reverses and I am on the receiving end. However, I can't help; you see.</p>

<p>They seriously hampered my growth, concealing several worldly concepts; prominent among them is generation gap. I still do not have a clear idea of the above.</p>

<p>Among themselves, they share a peaceful relationship, as peaceful as Indo-Pak bilateral ties. Efforts are made to restore hostility, but me fail to do so.</p>

<p>Together, they are a force to reckon with. You will always find them praising me. Be it anyone, they will definitely say something about me. Believe me if you have met my parents, you will love to run away from me. Ignorance is bliss, then.</p>
