<p>A career in defence was always my ambition and my entry into Indian Military Academy (IMA) was a dream-come true. Since I was a student of Mathematics, it was expected that I would take Engineering Entrance Examination (say IIT-JEE and so on). I on the other hand always thought of Uniform-services (Defence, Police�) as my career. Took National Defence Academy (NDA) entrance thrice but failed consistently, because of my conviction in solving the equation rather than assigning the values.</p>

<p>The resultant was a plain graduation i.e. B.Sc with honours in Mathematics. Even there too, my spirits, my morals & my attitude took me to scale new heights and I was placed 19th in a class of 22. I was passing through a rough patch, but I was very much sure that it would not last long.</p>

<p>After this, I cleared Combined Defence Services Examination (CDSE) in Sept-Oct 1999, then 2-AFSB Mysore in Feb-Mar 2000 and was selected for both AIR FORCE (Fighter Pilot) and ARMY (Permanent Commission). A pair of glasses came in between but I was given the option to join Indian Military Academy Dehradoon.</p>

<p>Two points to ponder:</p>

<p>If a guy like me can clear a National Level Examination (such as CDSE), then one should seriously (re) think about our Education system. In addition, if a person like me can clear a selection test, (like SSB, which comprises of GD, Physical Tests, Personal Interview, Psychological Tests�) then there is definitely some fault with the procedure. I seriously think so. What do you think?</p>

<p>Anyway, let us carry on�</p>

<p>Joined IMA (July 2000) (what a feeling man! as they say�). Nothing can compare. I still feel it�s the sweetest thing I�ve ever tasted. I was doing well there. In my brief stay, I was offered some post as well (like the ones offered in NCC). I was good at running, rolling, push-ups � and worst in rope climbing. I was enjoying every bit of it from Dinner to Mussoorie nights, those open, unlimited, unconditional accesses to slang(s), forty winks in classes with open eyes (siesta) � and so much more. Drill was my favourite, since it was the easiest. For rest all the things, we have to double up (run). It was heaven and I was having fun. But my dream-run had met with an untimely end and my so-called morning was a cloudy one.</p>

<p>A pair of hopes came in between, and after tremendous trilateral discussion along with some negotiation, I have to leave IMA. Tears and Sweat � all wet. It was a heart wrenching experience. Sometimes, I still feel that those were the best days of my life, but most of the times I satiate myself with the things life still has to offer.</p>

<p>My life took a pause after that and that pause, continues�</p>

<p>I (hope) have learnt a lot from this fiasco. Some of them are:</p>

<p>First, humiliation is a source of inspiration. Second, patience is by nature, impatient. Third, Loud silence is better than meek submission. Last but not the least, sacrifice is one of the ways to live life to the fullest.</p>
