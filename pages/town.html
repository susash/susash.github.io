<p>Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is a fascinating amalgam of scenic beauty, old historic city and modern urban planning. It is the 11th century city Bhojpal, founded by Raja Bhoj, but the present city was established by an Afghan soldier, Dost Mohammed (1707-1740). His descendants build Bhopal into a beautiful city.</p>

<p>The two lakes of Bhopal still dominate the city, and are indeed its nucleus. Bordered along their shores stand silent sentinels that testify to the growth of the city. Bhopal today presents a multi-faceted profile; the old city with its marketplaces and fine old mosques and palaces still bears the aristocratic imprint of its former rulers, among them the succession of powerful Begums who ruled Bhopal from 1819 to 1926. Equally impressive is the new city with its verdant, exquisitely laid out parks and gardens, broad avenues and streamlined modern edifices. It is greener and cleaner than most cities in the country.</p>

<p>The sprawling industrial township of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) spread over 19.56 sq. kilometer and having a population of about 1.5 lakhs, has a quaint charm of its own. This modern township has been maintained with excellent amenities for residential quarters, shopping centers, hospitals, schools, colleges, parks, clubs etc.</p>

<p>Apart from all these, Bhopal is known for "Zarda", "Garda", "Parda" and "Nāmarda". I hope that you all are aware of the above terminologies. It is also known for its "Khātirdaari" and "Nawabi". One excellent thing about Bhopal is that it has a culture of its own. Believe it or not, it is exotic. Come one, come all, to feel it, and you will never forget it.</p>
