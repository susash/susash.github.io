<p>There is a problem called Existential Import (E.I) in elementary logic, by virtue of which Aristotle's Syllogisms are partially refuted. Modern logicians consider E.I and deny existence for Universal Propositions. Aristotle's perspective grants (pre-suppose) existence to Universal Proposition as well. (Not to mention, both Modern Logicians and Aristotelian perspective admits of existence in Particular Propositions).</p>

<p>
Given this, there are certain syllogisms (arguments) which are valid in Aristotle's perspective whereas invalid in modern point-of-view. The modern perspective is embraced by Venn Diagrams and Boolean algebra and is widely accepted. To check the validity of Aristotle's syllogism, Euler diagrams were used and arguably, now are outdated.</p>

<p>
I am trying to device a diagrammatic representation, which can satisfy both the Aristotle's and Modern logicians view point. The representation will take care of the details of argument and reasoning, and a single diagrammatic representation will satisfy both the conditions. This will help us to reason either with or without presupposition. The above-mentioned diagrams will then be tested for its completeness &amp; consistency with the rules of propositional logic. It further aims to enquire the possibility of using the proposed diagrammatic technique in enthymemes, sorites and other arguments (which does not follow the syllogistic structure). The study will also explore the proposed diagrammatic technique's possible limitations.</p>
