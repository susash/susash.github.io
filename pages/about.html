<p>The heavens wept and his mum screamed in the realm of 23.16 N, 77.36 E at 0640hrs IST, on another Monday when this lad was born. After a couple of years of survival, the divinities were informed about the blunder made, of sending a misfit on this planet. To restitute the error, he was consecrated with jaundice &amp; pneumonia at the same time. Due to ineptitude of gustation, he survived the restoring mechanism gulping 100 ml of astringent syrup per day. This is how, the evil forces (medication) won over the divine will, then.</p>

<p>The lad grew and looked like a normal boy, but lacked the essential capabilities. It is redundant to disclose those, since it never made a difference. We hope it will make a difference someday. He went to several schools &amp; colleges and was destined to be a mediocre, since brilliance was out of question and the initial medication restricted dullness. Amidst all these, he sometimes and somehow scaled the heights, due to planetary positions, I suppose. Moreover, blessed with these inabilities, he still manages to tread far.</p>

<p>The second attempt to restore the initial blunder came when he was 20. He suffered from a dreaded disease and was on the brink of his last breath. However, the same old story was repeated diagnosing a simple case of cold, cough &amp; fever as f. malaria by the Satan (doctor). The boy won the battle shedding 21lbs of mass and getting prone to such attacks ever after. Once those refurbish mechanisms were combated, the immortals tried a different way out.</p>

<p>A judgement was pronounced which read, everything and anything desired by the guy will be seized from his clutches with immediate effect from the day, he will turn 21. His wishes ceased from that day, but was blessed with getting what he never dreamt of or expected, and getting it bigger and better. The reason behind this paradox is simply the fact that he can't think for his betterment or good; the only thing that he can think for himself is not up to the mark, if not worse. The guy still survives completing more than a quarter of century on this planet and is located on or around 26.27 N, 80.24 E presently. He has his dreams, which are destined to doom and curses his existence that is beyond his wish. He never understood the raison d'&ecirc;tre for all those misfortunes, i.e. his well-being.</p>

<p>The anonymous misfit</p>
